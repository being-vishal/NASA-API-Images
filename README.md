# NASA-API-Images
  <ul>
    <li>In this project I have used an API provided by NASA to make a website which shows images related to astronomy and also provides description for that image.
    <li>The API which I used is <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/#browseAPI">APOD:Astronomy Picture Of the Day</a>
    <li>This project has made my DOM manipulation skills robust. I learnt about objects in javascript.
